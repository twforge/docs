== Creating Your Account

. Go to https://twforge.net[twforge.net]

. Sign in with your preferred method (Google, Discord, etc.)

== Adding a World

After logging in, you'll see the world selection screen.

== Navigating the App

Once you've added a world, you'll see the main menu with all available features:

== Syncing Your Data

TW Forge automatically syncs data from your world:

* Player and tribe data
* Your battle reports (with userscript)

To keep data current, the app periodically refreshes in the background.

== Installing the Userscript (Optional)

For automatic report import, install the TW Forge userscript:

. Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey)
. Go to **Account** → **Userscript**
. Click **Install Userscript**
. Play the game normally – reports are captured automatically
