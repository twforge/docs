= Action Planner

The Action Planner helps you coordinate attacks with your tribe.

== Overview

Use the Action Planner to:

* Create attack plans with precise timing
* Organize attacks into campaigns
* Share plans with tribe members
* Track which attacks have been sent

== Creating a Campaign

Campaigns group related attacks together.

. Go to **Action Planner**
. Click **New Campaign**
. Enter a name (e.g., "Operation North")
. Click **Create**

TIP: Create separate campaigns for different operations to stay organized.

== Adding Attack Plans

. Open your campaign
. Click **Add Plan**
. Select your **source village** (where troops come from)
. Select the **target village**
. Choose the **units** to send
. Set the **arrival time**
. Click **Save**

The system calculates the send time automatically based on unit speed.

== Coordinating Multiple Attacks

To land multiple attacks at the same time:

. Add all your attack plans to the campaign
. Set the same arrival time for each
. The Action Planner shows each plan's send time
. Send your attacks at the calculated times

== Sharing with Your Tribe

. Open your campaign
. Click **Share**
. Copy the share link
. Send it to your tribe members

Shared campaigns let others see the plan and add their own attacks.

== Tracking Execution

As you send attacks:

. Mark each plan as **Sent** when you launch it
. The campaign shows progress at a glance
. Review completed attacks after the operation

== Tips

* Plan attacks a day ahead to give everyone time to prepare
* Use filters to find specific villages quickly
* Export plans to spreadsheets if needed
