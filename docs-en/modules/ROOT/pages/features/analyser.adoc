= Analyser

Analyze targets to plan better attacks.

== What It Does

The Analyser helps you:

* Estimate enemy defenses
* See attack history on targets
* Decide how many troops to send

== Analyzing a Target

. Go to **Analyser**
. Enter or select a target village
. Click **Analyze**

The Analyser shows:

* Recent attacks on this village
* Estimated defense strength
* Attack recommendations

== Understanding Results

=== Defense Estimate

Based on available reports, the Analyser estimates:

* Likely troop count
* Wall level
* Overall defense strength

NOTE: Estimates are based on reports. More reports = better estimates.

=== Attack History

See all recorded attacks on the target:

* When attacks happened
* What was sent
* The outcome

== Planning Your Attack

Use the analysis to decide:

* **Troop count** – Send enough to overcome estimated defense
* **Attack type** – Full attack vs. scout first
* **Timing** – Coordinate with tribe if defense is strong

== Tips

* Import reports before analyzing for best results
* Re-analyze after new attacks for updated estimates
* Combine with Action Planner to create attack plans
